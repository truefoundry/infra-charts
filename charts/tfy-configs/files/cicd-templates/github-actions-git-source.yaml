description: "The application spec will be stored in the source code as a separate YAML file (truefoundry.yaml). You will need to change the truefoundry.yaml to make any changes to the application. Changes done from UI will be overriden with every git push. Choose this approach if you want to only change application via Git pull requests. **Preferred approach for production environments.**"
