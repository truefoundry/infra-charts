description: "This case should only be done when you are setting up CI/CD on code not stored in a Git repository or if the Git source is not integrated with Truefoundry. In this case, the application spec will be stored in the source code as a separate YAML file (truefoundry.yaml). On every push, the code will be uploaded to Truefoundry, where it will be built and deployed. **Choose this approach only if the Git repositories cannot be integrated with Truefoundry.**"
