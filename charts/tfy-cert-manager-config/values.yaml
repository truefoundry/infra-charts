## @section Configuration for certificate manager
##
## This section configures one or more cert-manager Issuers and their Certificates.
## Each key under `issuers` (e.g. issuer1, issuer2) represents a separate Issuer +
## Certificate pair that will be rendered by the chart.

## @param issuers [object] Map of issuers and their certificate configuration
issuers: {}
  ## Example issuer configuration (issuer1). Duplicate and rename (issuer2, issuer3, ...)
  ## to manage multiple issuers and certificates.
